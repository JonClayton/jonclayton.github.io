          <p>We started JavaScript this week, leaving behind the warm, comfortable Ruby environment for what feels right now like a wildly unpredictable world full of braces. If you were a teenager with bad teeth, you'd hate that word, braces, but a novice JavaScript programmer is going to be having nightmares about obscure error messages, the most comprehensible of which tells you that you need to hunt down where you failed to put in the needed }. Ugh!</p>
          <p>But enough whining about syntax.  My task here is to walk through one of the differences we've already encountered between the two languages. I'm going to talk about documentation, and what I think it a related issue, the philosophy around native methods/functions.</p>
          <p>I'll be honest here. I loved the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/">Ruby Docs</a>. And I miss them already. The Ruby Docs had great indexing, let you see everything that was available on a very long page so Cmd-F (Ctrl-F for Windows people like I still am about half the time) was a great tool to find what you needed if you knew the name, and browsing through them was a voyage of discovery, letting you see new methods and ponder when they could save you time in the future.</p>
          <p>Now we are in the world of JavaScript guides. I assume DBC is trying to direct us to the most useful version at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference">Mozilla Developer Network</a>. It might not be the best, but I've browsed around and haven't found anything better. Why is that? Especially given JavaScript is a <strong>vastly</strong> more important language, used on almost every webpage anyone looks at. Heck, it's even used on my website because I have Google's prettify tool installed to make my embedded code look better. But I digress.</p>
          <p>What's frustrating about the JavaScript guide? To be perfectly honest and a little self-critical, it's probably mostly that it's hard to find an answer that works for what I'm trying to do. But here's the thing....JavaScript probably doesn't have what you're looking for!  It is quite different from Ruby.  Ruby has a nearly countless supply of customized objects, through a family tree of parent and superparent classes, and even more methods available natively for instances of those classes.  JavaScript essentially expects you to build your own objects, providing only a tiny number of native types that we've seen so far (array, string, number, map) and a few "toolsy" objects like Math, Date, and Intl). So what looks like a JS guide that doesn't give you much information is still probably pretty complete.  It's sort of like comparing an English-French dictionary to a English-Klingon dictionary.  The latter just isn't going to be very satisfying if you are trying to look up something specific.</p>
          <p>However, I have found the JS documentation actually gives fairly good illustrations of what you can do with each of the functions, operators, objects, etc. that are included in the documentation. This contrasts with the Ruby Docs, where examples can be absent or terse to the point of being obscure, and often use a formulaic phrasing that is not always meaningful to the newcomer.  What the heck is an Enumerator anyway?  And why do I sometimes get one back from a method that I thought would give me an array? It's good that JavaScript gives us good examples, and I also suspect we'll find Stack Overflow has an even more extensive knowledge base in JS than in Ruby.  In fact I just looked.  There are 980K JS questions versus under 150K for Ruby, and in the fifteen minutes before I looked there had been 11 JS questions and only one Ruby question asked.  So Stack Overflow is going to be a very valuable tool for our JavaScript research.</p>
          <p>That's going to wrap up my blog today. I need to work on my game. I have big dreams for this week, and need to get the MVP out the door and all the other work done to I can dig into this.</p>
