          <p>This post will eventually be about working with the #slice_when method. But first a little rambling about why I chose this method. Our assignment was to teach an Enumberable method in Ruby to our readers. Picking a method was a challenges. Many methods are simple and self-explanatory (like #max, #min, #first, #last) and wouldn't take any time to explain. Others are already becoming familiar to our cohort (like #map/#collect). Some are suggested in the assignment (#group_by, #cycle) so there will likely be a bunch of posts on them, and my post wouldn't be particularly interesting.</p>
          <p>The obvious one we all need to learn more about is #grep. But that is by defintion (Globally search a Regular Expression and Print) used primarily with regular expressions, a topic we haven't covered and RegEx clearly falls into "black magic", meaning I find it hard to understand how it works, much less explain it. Similarly #inject and #reduce are super powerful, but with a hint of black magic. Just think about all that work to build factorial(num) when it's just (1..num).reduce(:*)!!!</p>
          <p>At this point you should be wondering, since it was in my title, "I'm here for golf! When do we tee off?" Well, I'm getting to it.  Code Golf is a sometimes derogatory term for the exercise of writing the shortest possible code needed, even if it results in much less clear code. The wikipedia article is very interesting and sort of amazing/silly. In a way, using #reduce to calculate factorials is a very mild version of Code Golf because at this point in DBC we're supposed to making sure we can build the logically structured code it take to generate the steps one at a time that #reduce does internally all at one.</p>
          <p>Another Code Golf behavior is stringing lots of methods together to accomplish on one line what might be done in a series of steps that would be easier to follow if they were spelled out. We're already accepting as proper using #each rather than an explicit loop to iterate through an array, so I think we're going to see method stringing become more acceptable as we go along. I don't find it nearly as objectionable as black magic methods, because all the steps are still there in the code. You just have to read the string carefully.</p>
          <p>So for every "create a method" exercise we've had, I've tried to come up with a way to do it in a single expression. It was not too hard in week 4, but it got a lot harder here in week 5, especially when we were asked to come up with a method to calculate modes from arrays, which could be either a collection of numbers or a collection of words. I did get there, but I kindof had to cheat for the firs time by pushing my recursion onto the end of the expression when I think Ruby syntax would say it needed to be on the next line. I'll show that to you below. But the point here is that looking through the Enumberables methods carefully I realized that I could have used one of them to make my mode(array) method a somewhat better gold shot and avoid the need for recursion to make it work.
          </p>  
          <h2>#slice_when</h2>
          <p>There is a HUGE, awful pun lurking here that I haven't the heart to figure out, related the notion that a slice can be a good thing in this kind of golf. But first the basics. #slice_when allow you to iterate through an array (or ordered hash), breaking it into pieces, cutting at points where the condition is satisfied. Sure, you hear that, but it takes examples to understand it.</p>
          <h3>Breaking a paragraph into sentences</h3>
          <p>Imagine your input is a string of text that is a whole paragraph, much like what we write in our text processors (that then extend way to right when that file is displayed at GitHub!). You want to break it into sentences. Let's see what happens: </p>
          #split  I know split.  That's going to do it, right?  Just split at the periods.
          code
          Oops, all those stray spaces and it took away my periods.  And look at what happened when I wrote code.
          Try again.  This time let's split on spaces
          code
          Worked better.  In face this is the default for #split, and it cleaned up all the spaces.
          code
          Now we have words, and conveniently the words at the end of sentences all end with periods.  Now we want to break our big array of words into a set of smaller arrays, and we want to have the breaks occur when we see a word with a period at the end.  Time for #slice_when!!!
          code
          Wait, what the heck is that! Disaster! Nonsense! I don't even understand.  Settled down...this is a method on Enumerables, and it returns an Enumerator.  We can't read it unless we put it into an array or hash
          code
          Now we are talking!  Just need to turn each of these arrays within the bigger array back into sentences:
          code
          Done. Now let's play some golf. If we add methods to the end of an expression, Ruby will perform that method on the result of what came before it. One thing to keep in mind is that in our multiline code above, we've either used destructive methods or had to set our variable equal to the result of the method to make that method destructive. When we combine them in expressions, that isn't an issue since the next method is performed on the result of the prior method.
          Alright, that's the end of the front nine on our golf course.  Time for a beer and then we'll turn to an application of #slice_when that may not be real world, but definitely applies to the Island Foxes: finding the mean of an array of numbers.  Obviously if you haven't completed Exercise 5.3 you should stay in the clubhouse and work on it rather than come with us to the back nine.
          <h2>Finding Modes</h2>
          The obvious way to do Exercise 5.3 was to iterate through the items in the array, building a hash with item "name" keys and value equal to the number of times that item appeared.  Then manipulate that hash to find the highest number of occurrences and get the associated keys into an array.  But thanks to #slice_when we can do all that my manipulating the original array!
          Sort the array
          code
          Slice the array between each cluster of the same item. But, you might ask, how can #slice_when do that?  We used it to decide when to cut based on whether an element had a period in it.  How can we tell it which instance of a number to slice after.  We can--I just didn't tell you that you actually have two arguments to use in #slice_when...the element before AND the element after the position of the slice.  So you can use both of those in a boolean expression to decide whether to slice between them.  And since we sorted the array, it's an even simpler boolean than we used on the sentences.
          code
          Now we are cooking. The next step is to replace each of these rather repetitive arrays with something more useful: an array much like the hash we talked about above, with the item as the first element and the number of occurences as the second.  #map does this very nicely for us:
          code
          Does the end feel close now?  The easy way to get done from here would be to iterate through this array twice: first to find the highest number of occurences and then to find the items associated with that number:
          code
          We can even do it with one iteration through the array if we are a little inventive:
          code
          But there's a problem for the golfers among us. Neither of these approaches are useful for golfing. The first one sort of branches our tree by using the array in two different ways. We can make this a single expression but it involves building the whole tree twice. This generates a result so ugly I won't even show it to you until the end of this post because it will make you run away screaming.
          The single iteration approach above is actually a little more promising and I'll work on that and add it at the end too.  But there is a path we can follow that conveniently again uses a slice to get us onto the green.  We sort the array to get all the modes at the front
          code
          and we #slice_when again (we use #slice_when, but if we didn't want to keep the all the information in the array it would be a bit simple to use #take, which would discard the rest after the modes:
          Code
          We are putting for the win now, and it's not a hard putt.  We #map the first element of the arrays that contain the modes into a new array, and to make sure all this slicing and sorting hasn't messed up the order, we'll do one last #sort.
          Code
          So we've made this work.  Now we just want to see if we can get a hole-in-one in Code Golf.  String together all the methods we've performed consecutively on the same array:
          code
          <h2>It's in the hole!</h2>
          Time for a little dance! And also a bit of a wry look, because although this is just one expression, it is very long and would be hard to parse if you hadn't walked through it step-by-step.  So let's compare to what my first hole-in-one solution was:
          code
          <h3>Other memorable golf shots</h3>
          Before I show you the one line method I had before I understood #slice_when, best for a bit of pseudocode because the logic is very different, and it does rely on a recursive method:
          Input: an array of items, in no particular order, one or more of which recur so there are one or more modes (mode means it appears the most times, ties are possible)
          
          Output: an array with the names of the modes, each appearing only once in the array.

          Overall approach: reduce the contents of the array down to the modes by iterating through the array tone copy of each remaining in the array

          Important new method: Array#uniq, which returns an array containing one of each item that appears in the array.  Essentially it is deleting all duplicates.

          Details:
          We know we are done when we get down to an array where every item in it appears only once
          So WHILE array has duplicate elements
            Get the #uniq version of the array
            Iterate through the #uniq array, deleting from the primary array one occurrence of the element from the #uniq array
            Repeat this until the WHILE is satisfied
          Sort the resulting array and report it.
          Let's see this loop in action one step at a time:
          code

          Now you get the underlying logic.  But you wonder how that works in one line.  Two more tools at work: ternary expression and recursion.  A ternary is really an IF-THEN-ELSE writen as 
          IF condition ? THEN action : ELSE action
          So let's write out what's going to happen:
          IF my array has no duplicate items
          THEN sort and return it
          ELSE delete one copy of each AND do this IF-THEN-ELSE on the result

          The recusions is really just that last bit....do it again on the result of what I just did.  We call the method again on the result of running the method once, and keep doing that until we are done, whatever done means.

          The IF is simple:
          code
          As is the THEN
          code
          Here's the first part of the ELSE
          code
          And the recursion part of the else
          Code
          put it all together into the ternary statement and you get:
          Code
          As I said, I think the && glueing what is effectively another expression/action into the ternary probably means this is not a true "one line solution."  But its brevity and clarity make it a lot more attractive than the much longer and complex hole-in-one above.

          And now, for those who have stuck this out because of the promise of a horror show at the end, the two treed solution that I mentioned above.  You might want to close your eyes.
          UGLY UGLY CODE.

          This makes me impose another requirement on my efforts to write one line methods. They cannot be less DRY than the multiline version (which will always happen if the logic has a fork in it).  But as long as the one line version uses the same logic, I think it is OK to write, helps you learn new methods, and is fun in a very geeky way.

          If you actually got to this point, please send me an email.  You deserve some sort of prize.......










          Hmmmm....this needs explanation, since it has a very different logic 






          Let's go have a beer and then come back to something even more practical: DBC Phase-0 Exercise 5-3.
