          <p>I decided to investigate the designing for accessibility topic because J. Ky's discussion of the Atomic CSS framework in the video last week and our focus on semantic HTML made me wonder how all those individual style classes would work for people relying on semantic CSS who might prefer class names more related to the type of element than the details of how it would be styled.</p>
          <p>As I worked through a few websites on accessibility some interesting topics came up.  Some made me realize that accessibility is a topic for lots of users beyond those with life-altering personal challenges like physical or visual limitations. For example, have you ever tried to navigate a website on your phone that just wouldn't work because there were pull-down menus your couldn't successfully operate? Well, welcome to the world that people who can't use a mouse face every day! Similarly, do you run into websites that are hard to read on your phone in bright light due to lack of contrast? Or have problems because there are images that you just can't zoom in on or otherwise get large enough to see clearly?  I sure have.  This are the same problems visually impaired users have with those sites every day.</p>
          <p>Another topic that matters for accessibility is one we already ran into: how to use CSS and HTML to get elements to land where we want them on the page and screen. I was tempted to do lots of things to force elements where I wanted them despite where they wanted to go in the natural flow of the page. But people relying on text readers can only use the natural flow, so we should avoid breaking it, but rather working with it.  So columns would be better than tables, for example.</p>
