<!--
How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
-It was good because two head avoid doing things that are really not going to work. But it also means a more generic template given the page was something we ultimately needed to personalize

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
-Well, we will see but I can't imagine it isn't helpful to think through structure before just spewing code. I suspect it will be more helpful when we have more experience with how to turn the wireframe into code.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
-It needs to capture the things that need to be on the page and organize them in a reasonable way.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
-Header from HTML5 and I think footer too.  A little confusing since we already have h1, h2, etc.  We kept this simple so we'll be finding more semantics promptly, I suspect.
