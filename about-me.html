<article>
<p>This is going to be the bare minimum so I can turn it in because I have my GPS at noon PST and want to see the materials for it ASAP.  So if you see this before it gets changed, you can mock my totally unstyled webpage!</p>

<p>I was born and raised in Arlington, Virginia, just across the Potomac from Washington, D.C.  I went to Princeton as an undergraduate, majoring in Economics.  Then I went to law school at the University of Virginia, moved to Houston, and started practicing law.  It made me miserable.  So I quit and went to business school, which was a lot of fun (more than my other two degrees had been) because I was genuinely interested in every class I took. </p>

<p>After business school I joined McKinsey & Company as a consultant, where I moved through a couple of different roles. Now I'm looking for a job that I'll love every day and I'm pretty sure software development will qualify. DBS so far has confirmed that expectation, since it is a blast, though I will admit I like programming a lot more than HTML and CSS.</p>

<p>My hobbies: I play a lot of softball. I like computer games, mostly single player strategy like Civilization, or fantasy like Diablo. But I really don't often have time to dig into them the way I would like to. Having grown up in Washington, I find myself more interested in the reality TV show that is the presidential race than in any other reality TV. I also read a fair amount. I recently got a FitBit and the competitiveness it creates has made me a very conscientious walker (have to get my 10K steps per day). On my walks I listen to podcasts, currently John and Hank Green's weekly podcast (which I am current on) and Freakonomics, which I'm getting close to catching up on. So I need a suggestion for a tech podcast or two that would get me interview-worthy knowledge.</p>

<p>Something quirky...My daughter says I don't laugh. Not quite true, but LOL is unusual for me.</p>
<p>Not good enough? How about my insistence on using public transportation? That may not sound quirky to those of you who live in cities with good public transit, but Houston is not one of them. I recently took public transit to the airport and it takes almost two hours from my house, when driving would take 30 minutes.  And trust me when I say that there was nobody like me on the bus.</p>

<p>Well, that's it for now.  I'll come back and improve this later on Monday.</p>
