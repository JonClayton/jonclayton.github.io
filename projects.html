	<p>My first shareable project was a working Bingo game in Ruby.  You can find the code <a href="https://github.com/JonClayton/phase-0/blob/master/week-6/bingo_solo_challenge_solution.rb">here</a>.  Please feel free to copy it and paste it into a Ruby file to run and test it out.

	<p>My second shareable project is a game. I'm working on a checker game. You can see the progress of my code here <a href="https://github.com/JonClayton/phase-0/blob/master/week-7/design-basic-game-solo-challenge/my_solution.js">here</a>. The program is in Javascript. You'll need to copy/paste it to run in your own environment until such time as I have it running as a webpage, in which case I plan to update this page.  Wish me luck!</p>
