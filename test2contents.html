<p>Welcome to my massively improved website.  You might not appreciate how much so unless you saw the old version.
</p>
<p>This is sort of here as a placeholder because everything interesting is elsewhere.  But I do have two suggestions:</p>
<ul><li>Take a look at my projects.  The checkers game is pretty good for a project done in the pre-work for Dev Bootcamp in the first week we used JavaScript.</li>
<li>Also take a look at my blog.  Quality of the content varies, but I try to be a bit lighthearted about it.</li></ul>
<p>My next task is to roll this much improved layout and visual framework (yes, borrowed entirely from Mondrian) to the blog and other subpages.  Of course, maybe I should just have the blog in this iFrame rather than some random stuff.....</p>
