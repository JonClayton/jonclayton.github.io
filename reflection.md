#What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
I found that although I understand the concept, the practice of figuring out which edges are affected by which CSS commands still feels like a huge amount of trial and error. The trick of putting borders on every element until you work it all out is a good one, but I still felt like this was taking me way too long to do. 

#What did you learn about CSS positioning?
It continues not to be intuitive.  I need to spend a lot of time on it this coming week to feel comfortable.  We'll see at the GPS, I suspect!

#What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
Probably the hardest part was dealing with photos.  The easiest part was getting things intended to be on the edges in roughly the right places because they could be fixed or floated there.

#What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
Although this was painful, I do see how much better it is to work withing CSS rather than styling individual elements.  I just need to get the hang of understanding in advance which items need separation and class assignment
