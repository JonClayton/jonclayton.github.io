	<p>My first shareable project was a working Bingo game in Ruby.  You can find the code <a href="https://github.com/JonClayton/phase-0/blob/master/week-6/bingo_solo_challenge_solution.rb">here</a>.  Please feel free to copy it and paste it into a Ruby file to run and test it out.

	<p>My second shareable project is a game. I'm working on a checkers game. You can see it <a href="checkers.html">here</a>. I am pretty excited. It runs for two players, applying all the checkers rules. </p>

	<p>Things I plan to take a shot at but am not sure I can get them to work: Implement at least a little AI so it can be played against the computer. I would be able to leverage that logic to highlight the moveable pieces for human player(s) and once they select one, show the places they can be moved.</p>
