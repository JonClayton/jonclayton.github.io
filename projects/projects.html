	<p>My first shareable project was a working Bingo game in Ruby.  You can find the code <a href="https://github.com/JonClayton/phase-0/blob/master/week-6/bingo_solo_challenge_solution.rb">here</a>.  Please feel free to copy it and paste it into a Ruby file to run and test it out.

	<p>My second shareable project is a game. I'm working on a checkers game. You can see the progress of my code here <a href="checkers.html">here</a>. The program is now running within HTML using JavaScript, but I have more work to do on the interface.  Wish me luck!</p>
	<p>It currently understands and applies all the rules of moving in checkers, but it doesn't take direct user input (only playing out a series of pre-set move.  But I'm getting very close!</p>
