	<p>My first shareable project was a working Bingo game in Ruby.  You can find the code <a href="https://github.com/JonClayton/phase-0/blob/master/week-6/bingo_solo_challenge_solution.rb">here</a>.  Please feel free to copy it and paste it into a Ruby file to run and test it out.
	</p>

	<p>My second shareable project is a game. I'm working on a checkers game. You can see it <a href="checkers.html">here</a>. I am pretty excited. It runs for two players, applying all the checkers rules. </p>

	<p>But after "finishing" the checkers game, I actually found and read checkers rules and discovered things I didn't know.  If it's your turn and you can make a jump move, you have to do so. And if you jump one checker and can keep jumping with that piece, you have to keep jumping.  And if you get kinged, that ends your turn, so you can't jump to the back row and bounce back coming forward.  And if you can't make a legal move you lose.
	I incoporated the last of these into the first version, but the other two are going to require a significant revamping.  Which is fine, since the code is pretty messy and would benefit from a thoughtful rewrite.  </p>
